> :rocket: Hotel project made as part of the Frontend Master course from Dev Samurai.
> The idea was to develop a template website for an online travel business.
> With this application it would be possible for a company to register hotels and hostels, while clients utilize it to explore available options. But these features weren't implemented in this template.
> The technologies used were: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
